# Solana Minting Bot

## This bot will help you mint all the Magic Eden NFT's, This bot of does not guarantee a successful mint but increases chances as well as gives you the possibility to mint bypass the minting limit !

### Easy setup which uses ChromeDriver to open up a new chrome instance and mint the nft you are looking for quicker than a human. This bot does not guarantee you will get your NFT, this bot simply goes faster than humans to mint and automates everything since you do not have to click yourself.

### You can launch multiple instances of the bot to bypass minting limit / wallet
